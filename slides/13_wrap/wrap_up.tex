\begin{itemize}
  \item Main idea: link what's in the book to some theory or ideas about political violence we've covered
  \item No summary of the book
  \item Critique probably doesn't work either: many of these are journalistic books that tell what happened, not why or how (exceptions)
  \item Can cover one issue in depth or many more superficially
  \item \textbf{Word limit}: 2500 words (around 5/6 pages)
  \item Deadline is January 15 but can submit anytime
\end{itemize}

  \item[\textbf{Q1:}] (2 points, 500 words) Last January 6th, the US Capitol was stormed by a crowd of Trump supporters. Can we consider that event as an instance of political violence? Why or why not? Can we consider it as an example of a coup d'Ã©tat attempt? Why or why not?

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Q1:}] (2 points, 500 words) Last year, Israel designated six Palestinian organizations who carry out NGO work as terrorist organizations (see this news article in \textit{Haaretz}: \url{https://bit.ly/3GGCVeu}). The Israeli government claimed that, although these are NGOs, they ``are controlled by the senior leadership of the PFLP and employ many members of the group ... including activists who were involved in terrorism.'' [The PFLP, or Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is an armed organization that has been long designated as a terrorist organization by both the US and European Union, among other countries.] Do you agree with the Israeli decision? Why or why not?

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Q2:}] (4 points, 1000 words) Brexit, and the Northern Ireland Protocol in particular, has brought tensions to Northern Ireland. In Spring 2021 there were loyalist protests that eventually evolved into ethnic riots. Some voices now warn of the risk of larger scale political violence returning to the region. What do you think are the risk factors and/or what could be done to avoid another conflict? What is it different now than when the Troubles started in the late 1960s?

  \item[\textbf{Q2:}] (4 points, 1000 words) Protests have recently erupted in Kazakhstan and quickly escalated into violence between protesters and state forces, including Russian forces sent in by Putin, leaving more than 150 deaths, before calm returned earlier this week. What was the actual risk of large-scale violence in Kazakhstan? Should we be surprised that the protests did not escalate into e.g. a civil war? Is there risk of conflict in the short- to medium-term, like in other Central Asian countries?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ({\footnotesize There are many factors related to the escalation and onset of violence: structural conditions (economy, geography, ...), political relations (government/opposition dynamics, previous history of violence, ...), international politics, etc. You can focus on one of these factors or on many, and you can discuss risk factors, restraint factors (why a war is unlikely), or both. For background in Central Asia, you can check  \href{https://ucdp.uu.se/}{UCDP Encyclopedia}, \href{https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/}{EPR ethnic data}, Wikipedia, newspapers, etc.})
