# Notes February 17

- Political violence as intentional use of physical force to achieve political goals

### Types

- Many different things, problems of mixing things (from academic problems to just pure ideological agendas: e.g. terrorism, ISIS)
- What's the absence of political violence? Peace?

- Applied: ETA/IRA
  * What's the policy problem?
  * How do you approach it academically? What's the opposite of terrorism?
  * terrorism vs the absence of radical groups OR
  * terrorism vs non-violent radical politics

### Kalyvas typology

- Interstate war
  * Traditional views (before Clausewitz?)
  * war =/= rivalry
  * more developed because of carried out by developed organization
  * identification/coding

- Civil war
  * cw and internationalized cw: difference with interstate?
  * governmental/territorial
  * cw =/= cw violence, civilian/combatant distinction

- Terrorism
  * coercive violence, communicative violence etc - actor/action sense

- State repression
  * law of coercive responsiveness. violence against civilians?

- Genocide
  * aim of violence
  * genocide =/= policide. genocide =/= ethnic cleansing

- Communal violence
  * group definition is broad. usually form of violence within others (e.g. genocides)

- Protests etc
  * Problem of concept of "revolution"

- Coups
  * importance of the **threat** of violence.
  * usual problems. eg Capitol?

- Organized crime
  * why or why not would we consider it political violence
  * role to state building, similarities to rebel groups

- Assassination
  * diff with terrorism (not coercive)

### WALTZ

**Previous classic views**

- Clausewitz starts talking about wars as a rational human phenomenon, motivated by politics
- "War is the continuation of politics by other means"
- Against previous Enlightment view of war as a deviation and part of realist tradition (Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes)


- SO WHAT'S THE MAIN QUESTION HERE?
- What are the 3 images about?
- 1st image: man
  * main idea: human nature
  * Optimists and pesimists
  * Hans Morgenthau's *animus dominandi* & Reinhold Niebuhr's sinful nature
  * how do we solve war? hint: Enlightment
  * how common is actually this? problems? (human nature should explain everything)
- 2nd image: state
  * main idea: internal character of states (Kant again)
  * how do we solve war? hint: Woodrow Wilson
  * UKRAINE EXAMPLE
  * how common is actually this? problems? (liberal/marxist states cannot avoid bullies)
- 3rd image: system
  * main idea: no police
  * solution? world government, empire? (would this even work? think of civil wars)

- Principles of structural realism:
  * Actors? States
  * Law? Anarchy
  * Rules? Sovereignty
  * How? Power (internal monopoly + external struggle)

- Offensive vs defensive realism
  * Offensive: states want to increase their power
  * war is inherent to the system
  *
  * Defensive: states want to maximize security
  * War is about temporary incentives: security dilemma, elite beliefs etc

- PROBLEM: ACTUAL CAUSES OR PERMISSIVE CONDITIONS?
  * Waltz's immediate vs underlying casues
  * what's the underlying **cause** of wars? the system? human nature is a constant, but so is the system, no?
  *does this help us understand the causes of single wars?

### HOLSTI (chp 1)

**MAIN:** ecological studies vs historical approaches

- Explaining wars
- **Ecological variables** vs **immediate causes**: what should we look at?
- *Anything might lead to war, but nothing will certainly lead to war*
- Table: single independent variables, only one level of analysis, infinite causes
- Underlying vs proximate causes of war (Thucydides)
  * Example: how to explain civil wars? ethnic civil wars?
- **What are we actually explaining?**
- Ecological variables vs *ISSUES*
  * Historical approaches, understanding **conflict-generating issues** over time
  * (Link to next session)

### EXAMPLES?

- Example of Ukraine again?
- Maybe the Thucydides Trap and problems with its study
